Today's thought: Death to a Thousand Butters
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c5347cd9-9170-4e6b-9880-c5213c78aebb.jpg)

I'm going to go ahead and guess at how we get here:  
Someone opens a grocery store - a one-stop shop for all of your grocery needs.  
Everyone needs butter, lets put some in the dairy section between the milk and cheese (note: at this point, there would be one box of butter, with many more of the same box behind it waiting to be purchased)   
A new butter brand is launched - this one has salt added. Yum. The salesmen convinces the buyer his customers will want it to. "In fact," he says, "there are people walking your isles right now who aren't buying butter because it's kind of bland... but if you offer it with salt, they'll buy!" (now there are two boxes of butter).   
Enter the third brand. The salesman says people aren't buying butter because of the fat content. His is low-fat. (now there are three three boxes of butter)  
Brand one is starting to lose market-share. They're the name brand, but they won't be for long if they don't take action. They launch salted and fat-free variants. (now we have five boxes of butter)  
Enter a fourth competitor, not a name brand, but their butter is "sustainable" or "artisan" or whatever the argument du jour is. And so on and so on and so on, until we have a whole wall of butter with varying claims and call-outs.   
...eventually no matter your argument, the store's management is going to realize that the incremental additional sales of butter hardly justify cost of carrying so many variants and managing so many relationships.   
Maybe it's time to edit the selection to just the best two or three: One specialty, one house brand at the best cost, one other idea. 

**It's better business for the store and less stressful for the customer. But what does it mean for the brands? The answer is about to become clear.**
